                    <h3 class="center">Backstory</h3>
                    I have a keen interest in business, but there were many concepts frequently used by others that I didn't fully understand. Fortunately, in today's world, it's easy to research and learn about topics we're unfamiliar with. I conducted some research and now wish to share my findings with other aspiring entrepreneurs who want to deepen their understanding of business concepts. Let's dive in:
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="center">Expenses</h3>
                    Expenses are the costs that a business must pay. Examples include employee salaries, advertising costs, shipping fees, and more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="center">Profit</h3>
                    Profit is the amount a business retains after paying all its expenses.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="center">Liquidity</h3>
                    Liquidity refers to the available assets in a business that can be used to pay expenses. This is essentially the money a business has on hand and can use when needed.

                    <h3 class="center">Cash flow</h3>
                    Cash flow is the total amount of money moving in and out of a business. It includes both the income generated by the business and its expenses. An example of cash flow is when a business sells a product but must pay its employees for producing it.

                    <br>
                    <h3 class="center">Income</h3>
                    Income is the money a business receives. After expenses are deducted from income, the remaining amount is profit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="center">Equity</h3>
                    Equity is the value of the shares issued by a company and reflects the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities. Equity is often referred to as shareholders' equity or owner's equity, depending on the type of business entity.

                    <br>

                    Private equity refers to investment funds, typically organized as limited partnerships, that buy and restructure companies that are not publicly traded.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="center">Asset</h3>               
                    An asset is any resource owned by an individual or entity that is expected to provide future economic benefits.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="center">Net worth</h3>                   
                    Net worth is the total value of an individual's financial and non-financial assets minus any liabilities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="center">Wealth</h3>

                    <h3 class="center">IOU</h3>
                    An IOU stands for "I Owe You." It is an informal document acknowledging a debt owed. It is typically a written statement indicating that the issuer owes a specified amount of money or other resources to the recipient. You can think of your salary as an IOU.
